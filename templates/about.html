        Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller
        and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are members of the same family. Divided among several
        subfamilies, they are a form taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of
        a single common ancestral species), since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic
        birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.
        <br><br>
        Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or
        divers, grebes, gallinules and coots.

            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            <p>
                The word duck comes from Old English dūce 'diver', a derivative of the verb *dūcan 'to duck, bend down
                low as if to get under something, or dive', because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group
                feed by upending; compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen 'to dive'.
                <br>
                Pacific black duck displaying the characteristic upending "duck"
                This word replaced Old English ened/ænid 'duck', possibly to avoid confusion with other words, like ende
                'end' with similar forms. Other Germanic languages still have similar words for duck, for example, Dutch
                eend, German Ente and Norwegian and. The word ened/ænid was inherited from Proto-Indo-European; cf.
                Latin anas "duck", Lithuanian ántis 'duck', Ancient Greek νῆσσα/νῆττα (nēssa/nētta) 'duck', and Sanskrit
                ātí 'water bird', among others.
                <br>
                A duckling is a young duck in downy plumage[1] or baby duck,[2] but in the food trade a young domestic
                duck which has just reached adult size and bulk and its meat is still fully tender, is sometimes
                labelled as a duckling.
                <br>
                A male is called a drake and the female is called a duck, or in ornithology a hen.[3][4]

            <h3>Morphology</h3>
            <p>
                The overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and they are also relatively long-necked, albeit
                not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in
                being more rounded. The bill is usually broad and contains serrated pectens, which are particularly well
                defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly
                serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so
                in the highly aquatic species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the
                flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species
                of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while
                moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult
                typically precedes migration.
                <br>
                The drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a
                more female-like appearance, the "eclipse" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual
                dimorphism, although there are exceptions such as the paradise shelduck of New Zealand, which is both
                strikingly sexually dimorphic and in which the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The
                plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female. Female ducks have evolved to have a
                corkscrew shaped vagina to prevent rape.
